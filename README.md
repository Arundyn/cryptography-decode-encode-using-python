# cybersecurity python base code resource 

this project is a Python-based encoder and decoder tool developed as part of my journey in participating in the Lomba Kompetensi Siswa (LKS) for the Cybersecurity category.

The tool is designed to assist in basic encoding and decoding tasks, commonly encountered during cybersecurity training, CTF challenges, and cryptography exercises. It supports multiple encoding schemes such as Base64, Hex, Binary, and Caesar Cipher, among others.

Throughout the LKS competition, this tool served as a personal utility to speed up the analysis of encoded data and improve efficiency during time-constrained problem solving.
